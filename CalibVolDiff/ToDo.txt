1. For both VectAll and VectOuters, check whether the GPU 
    code is specialized for NVIDIA hardware constants, 
    such as WARP == 32. 

2. VectOuters and VectAll:
      Currently all the result arrays are copied
        back to CPU space, but only a small part
        of it is actually required. This filtering
        can be done on GPU so as to optimize 
        communication costs.

3. Make the seguential overhead, e.g., allocation of CPU/GPU arrays, 
        close to negligible by increasing the NUM_T, especially for 
        the Medium and Small datasets.
